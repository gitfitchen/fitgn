    "problem": {
      "heading": "When rails slip, service slows",
      "paragraph1": "Standard Gastronorm frames ride loose in bain-maries and saladettes. Every bump from a ladle or rapid pan swap sends rails drifting, breaking chill chains and forcing constant resets. Hardware fixes are clunky, and gaffer tape never survives cleaning.",
      "paragraph2": "The result: crooked pans, inconsistent presentation, and lost seconds that compound across the line. FitGN Rail is purpose-built to eliminate the wobble."

      "heading": "Locking or magnetic—your call",
      "description": "FitGN Rail adapts to existing wells with either a mechanical latch or a magnetic capture point. Both approaches deliver a tight, repeatable seal that keeps rails aligned from prep to close."
