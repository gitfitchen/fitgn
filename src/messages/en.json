      "title": "When rails slip, service slows",
      "body": "Standard Gastronorm rails sit loose in bain-maries and saladettes. Each ladle bump or fast pan swap nudges them out of alignment, breaks cold chains, and forces constant resets. Tape peels off after a few washes. Result: crooked pans, inconsistent presentation, and seconds lost every service."
