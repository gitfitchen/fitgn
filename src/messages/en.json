    "problem": {
      "title": "When rails slip, service slows",
      "body": "Standard Gastronorm rails sit loose in bain-maries and saladettes. Each ladle bump or fast pan swap nudges them out of alignment, breaks cold chains, and forces constant resets. Tape peels off after a few washes. Result: crooked pans, inconsistent presentation, and seconds lost every service."

      "title": "Locking or magnetic — your choice",
      "body": "FitGN Rail retrofits existing wells with either a mechanical click-lock or a high-grip magnetic option. Both deliver a tight, repeatable rail position from prep to close without drilling permanent holes."

    "about": {
      "title": "Born from a kitchen problem",
      "body": "In our own restaurant <strong>Fitchen</strong> in Gent, we were tired of GN rails that slipped every service. One night, founder <strong>Koen Mortier</strong> sketched a lockable version on a prep ticket. Together with <strong>Pauline De Schepper</strong>, who runs daily operations, that sketch became <strong>FitGN Rail</strong> — the first system that keeps every Gastronorm tray locked, level, and HACCP-safe."
