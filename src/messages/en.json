      "subtitle": "FitGN Rail is a modular kit of thick-gauge stainless rails that locks standard GN pans in place. Lay the rails over any bain-marie or saladette, click the segments together, and every opening stays aligned — no flex, no rattle.",
      "supporting": "Build the exact service grid you need with GN 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, and 1/9 rails that interlock in seconds and hold their geometry through the rush.",

      "title": "Born from a kitchen problem",
      "body": "<strong>Koen Mortier</strong> has operated <strong>Fitchen</strong> restaurants for over a decade and knows the GN struggle firsthand. After years of searching across Europe — including the latest supplier tour in November 2025 — every answer was the same: there is no solution, kitchens just “live with it.” <strong>Pauline De Schepper</strong>, a hospitality management student who spends her spare time on the line, was equally tired of chasing runaway pans. Together they designed the FitGN Rail so Belgian kitchens can finally lock their mise en place.",
      "proofPoints": [
        "10+ years of multi-site Fitchen service informs every tolerance and hygiene detail.",
        "Hundreds of hours lost to reseating GN strips inspired the click geometry that now holds firm.",
        "Tested daily in Gent before partner pilots — if it survives a Saturday rush there, it will in yours."
