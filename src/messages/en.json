      "subtitle": "FitGN Rail is a modular kit of Gastronorm rails that locks standard GN boxes in place. Lay the rails over any bain-marie or saladette, click the segments together, and every opening stays aligned.",
      "supporting": "Build the exact service grid you need with GN 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, and 1/9 rails that interlock in seconds and hold their geometry through the rush.",

      "title": "When rails slip, service slows",
      "body": "Loose Gastronorm rails slide, bow, and show asymmetry. Service teams waste time reseating pans, create waste and cleanup when GN boxes fall, and end up frustrated and looking unprofessional — everyone simply \"lives with it.\""

      "title": "Click-lock rails that stay put",
      "body": "FitGN Rail retrofits any GN well with stainless rails that mechanically lock together. The click geometry resists vibration, keeps trays perfectly level, and lifts out for easy cleaning — no drilling, no adhesives, just click and done."

      "title": "Born from a kitchen problem",
      "body": "<strong>Koen Mortier</strong> has operated <strong>Fitchen</strong> restaurants for over a decade and knows the GN struggle firsthand. After years of searching globally for an off-the-shelf fix, every supplier gave the same answer: there is no solution, kitchens just “live with it.” <strong>Pauline De Schepper</strong>, your direct contact and a student working shifts at Fitchen, encounters the same issue daily. Together they designed the FitGN Rail to solve it in their own kitchens and make the solution available to others."
